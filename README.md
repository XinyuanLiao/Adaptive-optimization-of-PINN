# Adaptive optimization of Physics-Informed NN
This repository is used to reproduce PINN's inverse problem code about Burgers equation, plus multi-task likelihood loss balance algorithm and adaptive activation function algorithm.

These frameworks and algorithms are derived from the following papers:
